How to use

```
node . videoid

node .

npm start videoid

npm start
```

You can run with `node .` or `npm start`

If you do not pass an argument `videoid` (`dQw4w9WgXcQ`) it will try to read from the `id.txt` file

If you get an ad, then run the program again until you do not get one.

The output will show in the console, and also be put into `output.txt`

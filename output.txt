the kitchen it's where all our favourite
things come from like hamburgers
spaghetti and creme brulee who creme
brulee you tapped that golden crust with
your spoon and the gooey sweetness just
spills out and then all of a sudden
there's that smell oh that's smell the
kitchen it's great but in the wrong
hands it's a deathtrap what kind of a
monster could do this you ask
what kind of a sick twisted mind could
turn the place where creme brulee comes
from into a horror movie
a monster like Scott Scott is a student
cook or Claire she's also a student cook
Scott and Claire seem harmless but if
they do not follow safe work practices
in the kitchen they're potential killers
let's start with clothes
Scott baggy top may be what he calls
fashion but it's what I call a kitchen
disaster waiting to happen if a baggy
sleeve or a hoodie drawstring should
dangle over an open flame it'll be Scott
rather than the steaks that ends up well
done better your shoes are also a
problem though well I say shoes it's the
kitchen not the beach Scott we wear
sturdy lace-up shoes when cooking to
protect our toes in case we drop a pan
there we go I don't know what you're
smiling at Claire you're almost as
dangerous lose the chui for starters we
don't need gum in the gumbo your short
hairs not bad with longer locks we'd
need to tie them up but your shirt is
also a problem sleeveless tops leave
your arms vulnerable to burns from
splashes steam or contact with anything
hot
good you know I think we're actually
getting somewhere oh dear I spoke too
soon
show me your hands have you come
straight from a car repair video Claire
those hands are filthy
wash them in soap and water and you can
wash yours too Scott we wash our hands
before preparing any meal not just when
we think they're dirty while you're
washing you should also remove your
rings
Claire's rings Scott you don't want to
lose them and your guests don't want to
find them going down their gullet now
let's see you hmm not bad
once you're each wearing a washable
apron and plastic gloves for hygiene I
think we might actually be safe to start
cooking what could go wrong now a lot
this is not how we want our meal
preparation to end cuts can be avoided
by observing a few basic rules
select the appropriate knife for the
task Scott that cleaver is too clumsy
for small ingredients try Claire's knife
instead ah when passing a knife off of
the handle not the blade a blunt knife
is a hazard so check it's sharp before
using
so the lesson is never test sharpness
using your fingers use some food holder
Claire when wiping a knife have the
sharp edge of the blade pointing away
from your hand or you may encounter a
fate similar to Scott's good she has
checked that the knife is sharp note the
position of Claire's fingers on the food
with the fingertips curled under note
also she is using a board to cut on and
not the expensive bench look how she has
placed the knife correctly lying flat on
the bench never like this
for pumpkins and large gourds use a
heavy knife to avoid nasty accidents
never play pranks in the kitchen got
that Claire and Scott avoid carrying
knives with other equipment and never
never never carry a knife with the blade
pointing forward
now shall we try that again this is the
correct way to carry a knife by the way
where are you going with that Scott oh
no you weren't
imagine what might have happened if you
threw it in there
[Music]
store knives away in racks when not in
use broken glass or crockery should be
swept up immediately avoid picking it up
with your hands
gather small pieces with several layers
of cloth or disposable towel then wrap
those in layers of paper and throw it
all in the bin in summary then to help
prevent cuts
select the appropriate knife for the job
use food to check sharpness use a board
and never cut towards yourself off of
the handle when passing knives
do not throw knives in the sink wipe
knives with the sharp edge pointing away
from your hand place knives flat on the
bench never play pranks in the kitchen
and always carry knives with the blade
pointing downwards store knives away in
their racks and attend to breakages
immediately to complete our list here
are a few extra tips remove foreign
objects like skewers from food before
using a chopper or cleaver don't attempt
to work on frozen meat never throw
knives or attempt to catch a falling
knife and always always concentrate if a
minor cut does occur rinse the wound
under cold water to remove any particles
of food or dirt then covered with a
dressing from the first-aid kit which
can be found in every safety conscious
kitchen for deeper cuts medical advice
should be sought from a qualified first
aider nurse or doctor
a burn is caused by dry heat and can be
avoided by using an oven mitt or thick
dry cloth do not use a wet cloth as heat
quickly convert water into steam to
avoid handles becoming hot take care not
to leave them over hot elements nor
should they hang over the edge of the
stove as they could be easily knocked
very good Claire but you should remove
metal objects like that ladle from hot
foods immediately so they don't become
hot as well and if you know a utensil or
pan is likely to be hot warn others who
might handle it and here is a perfect
example of why it is important for tops
to be close fitting what might have
happened if Scott was still wearing the
baggy hoodie we first saw him in if
clothing catches fire act immediately
don't run or wave your hands about the
casualty yes Scott that's you lie on the
floor and be covered with a fire blanket
a scald is caused by wet heat to avoid
scalding lift lids of hot pans away from
you so that the steam escapes without
reaching your face notice Claire does
not lean over the equipment and takes
care to pour slowly when straining food
so as to avoid splashing hot water
you're getting pretty good at this
Claire when opening ovens very good
Scott
he stood to the side to avoid any heat
that may escape from the oven when he
opens it and remember when removing hot
food from the oven
set it down on the stove or nearby bench
to avoid carrying it around the kitchen
oil and water do not mix so wipe
moisture from food before putting it in
the frying pan remember always cool food
before tasting it
oh no you don't Claire we don't double
dip the spoon without washing it in
between use two hands to carry large
containers but never overfill with hot
liquids in the case of superficial burns
hold the affected area under cold
running water for at least 10 minutes
for serious burns immediately seek
assistance from a nurse doctor or
qualified first aider to avoid fire
never leave cloth or paper near naked
flames it's too late Scott I saw it
if lighting a stove with a match strike
it before turning on the gas this is
especially important when lighting a gas
oven or grill fat should never be left
unattended if a fat fire does occur in
no circumstances put water on it the
liquids will mix and the fire will
spread instead turn the heat off and
cover the pan with its lid this will
deprive the fire of oxygen extinguishing
it fire extinguishers which every safe
kitchen must have should be checked
regularly to ensure they are operational
electrical equipment in the kitchen
helps make cooking easier but they can
still be very dangerous
what it's true allow cords to become wet
or stand in water while using them and
you could be in for a shock use
equipment with frayed cords and other
faults and you could be in for a shock
use equipment with wet hands and you
could be in for a shock hang on I'm
sorry I'm just saying be careful the
equipment is in good condition and not
near water you can still use it
besides you can't stop now I haven't
finished giving you your safety tips
about it
plug the machine into the wall then
switch it on
when finished do the process in Reverse
to avoid injury never put fingers near
blades use safety equipment when
necessary never use a knife or other
utensils to retrieve toast from the
toaster in case of electric shock do not
touch the victim until the power is
turned off as the current could be
transferred if it is not possible to
switch the power off use a nonconductor
such as wood rubber or rolled paper or
yes even a broom to push the victim away
from contact with the current stay with
the victim until medical help arrives if
you know CPR and the patient needs it
administer it immediately always observe
correct lifting practices here's how not
to lift from an oven lift Li like this
firstly ensure both hands are free bend
at the knees and use both hands to
remove the dish scott you need to go
back and watch this whole video again we
can't end a discussion of kitchen safety
without mentioning hygiene here are a
few things to remember keep food out of
the danger zone between five and sixty
degrees Celsius to stop bacteria
multiplying for frozen food in the
fridge not on the bench cook foods
thoroughly use separate chopping boards
for meat and vegetables don't let me
juices drip on other foods throw out
foods which have reached their use-by
dates clean up the kitchen as you go
wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly
wash your hands with hot soapy water
after going to the toilet blowing your
nose or touching your hair cover up any
cuts on your hands and of course store
poisons including cleaning fluids well
out of the reach of children or Scott
finally
always obey these golden rules if you
knock or spill it wipe it up and if you
drop it pick it up
finally never leave cupboard doors or
drawers open and never run in the
kitchen by observing basic kitchen
safety standards accidents will be
avoided ensuring you will have a killer
meal without killing the cook a Bon
Appetit
